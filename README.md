MedExpert is a web application developed for both patients and healthcare professionals, providing patients with easy access on medical consent/ EHR information that they care about and/ or reveal confusion on, giving suggestions on both educational portal development and patients informing process guidelines.   The two goals of MedExpert are to  1. help people understand their medical consent forms/ medical records  2. help healthcare professionals/ researchers understand what patients need to understand in their medical documents as well as what is important to patients, and adjust their service guidelines accordingly.
